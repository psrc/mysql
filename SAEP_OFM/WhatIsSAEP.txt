SAEP = Small Area Estimates Program. 
Block (internal use only) & Block Group (public release data) estimates of population, households, housing units from WA state Office of Financial Management (OFM).
Queries to read csv versions of the SAEP files to MYSQL, and combine with a block -level correspondence file to 4K zones for updated estimates by zone. 
Will require a bit of tailoring depending on CSV file structure.
